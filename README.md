Each lesson has a directory. 
Inside that folder there is a _homework_ directory. 
Inside that folder I'll place each exercise in it's own directory.

## Practice
Practice is mandatory to learn new languages.

The exercises should be comitted to a local branch and submitted as a Pull-Request to the master branch of your forked version.  
The exercises will be published in the repository and via Slack:
  - Exercises are numbered and placed in appripriate folders
  - Each exercise folder will have at least one file (named *main.py*) with details as part of its doc-string.
  - Details include a number/name, a link and a quick summary.
  - The summary does not replace the link, Read the exercise from the link.

Homework Exercise: Example 
Link: www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/04/30/13-fibonacci.html

Write a program that asks the user how many Fibonnaci numbers to generate and then generates them.
Take this opportunity to think about how you can use functions.
Make sure to ask the user to enter the number of numbers in the sequence to generate.(Hint: The Fibonnaci seqence is a sequence of numbers where the next number in the sequence is the sum of the previous two numbers in the sequence.
The sequence looks like this: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, â€¦)
